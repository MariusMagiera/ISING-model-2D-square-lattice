# ISING-model-2D-square-lattice
I used the Metropolis algorithm to simulate the 2D Ising model where L is the length of a lattice side, such that there are N=L^2 spins in a simulated lattice.  For each lattice the spins were randomly configured. Then I did 5000 measurements with 50 sweeps in between each measurement. I measured for 126 different temperatures.  I took the measurements for L in {4,8,16,32,64}.
