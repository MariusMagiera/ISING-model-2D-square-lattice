# ISING-model-2D-square-lattice
I used the Metropolis algorithm to simulate the 2D Ising model where L is the length of a lattice side, such that there are $N=L^2$ spins in a simulated lattice.  For each lattice the spins were randomly configured as $s=\pm 1$. Then I did $5000$ measurements with $50$ sweeps in between each measurement. I measured for 126 different temperatures. With steps of $\Delta T =-0.1$ for $T\in [5,3]$, $\Delta T =-0. 02$ for $T\in [2.95,2.45]$, $\Delta T =-0.005$ for $T\in [2.4,2.2]$ (critical region), $\Delta T =-0.02$ for $T\in [2.15,1.65]$,  $\Delta T =-0.1$ for $T\in [1.6,0.2]$.\\ I took the measurements for $L \in {4,8,16,32,64}$.
